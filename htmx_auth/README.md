# OAuth2 in HTMX

OAuth 2.0 (Open Authorization) is a protocol that allows a user to grant limited access to their resources on one site (referred to as the "resource server") to another site (referred to as the "client application") without exposing their credentials. This is commonly used for allowing third-party services to access resources on a user's behalf without sharing their passwords.
